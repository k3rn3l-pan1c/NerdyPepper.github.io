My currently startup page 



## JS query parser
It is now possible to change the search engine:

### Instructions
* Separate the search engine indicator and the search content with a comma (;)
* Suported websites indicators:
  * yt:  youtube
  * g:   google
  * git: github
  * sch: google.scholar

By default, if no indicator is provided, the search engine choosen is google.com
If an addres is given (http or https), you are redirected to that website.
