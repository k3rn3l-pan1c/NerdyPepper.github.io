My currently awesome startup page!

Provides fast links for:

## Custom commands
The search tab recognizes some commands. You can:

- Change the search engine **on the fly**. The command and query separator is a semicolon, `;`
	- **yt**:  youtube
	- **g**:   google
	- **git**: github
	- **sch**: google.scholar
- Perform quick translations:
	- **pt-en**: Portuguese to English
	- **en-pt**: English to Portuguese
- Follow a link if an address is given (http or https)

## Default Behaviour
By default the search engine chosen is google.com
